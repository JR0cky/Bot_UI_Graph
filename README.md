# Chatbot Feature Graph

The **Chatbot Feature Graph** is an interactive visualization tool designed to explore the functional landscape of 12 popular chatbots across varying domains. It maps chatbots to their specific features and core domains using a force-directed graph, where nodes representing bots, domains, and features are color-coded by category for intuitive distinction.

Users can actively query the dataset through a dynamic sidebar to filter views, hover over nodes to highlight network connections, and click to access detailed metadata and implementation screenshots. The tool further supports advanced exploratory analysis through customizable clustering algorithms (currently exposing **Agglomerative** and **Domain-based** models) that reveal latent community structures.

To ensure a smooth user experience, the system includes a comprehensive **interactive tutorial** that launches automatically for first-time users, providing a guided walkthrough of the graph’s visual encoding, navigation controls, and key analytical capabilities.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Force-Directed Graph**: Visualizes relationships between chatbots, features, and domains using Cytoscape.js.
*   **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter graph nodes by Bots, Domains, System Features, UI Features, and Chat Content via the sidebar.
*   **Clustering Analysis**:
    *   **Domain**: Clusters nodes based on their structural domain relationships.
    *   **Bot Types (Agglomerative)**: Uses agglomerative clustering to group bots based on feature similarity.
*   **Interactive Tutorial**: A step-by-step modal guide for new users, explaining graph concepts, navigation, and interactions.
*   **Detail View & Screenshots**: Click on feature nodes to view implementation details and actual screenshots of the feature in the chatbot UI.
*   **High-Resolution Export**: Export the current graph view as a high-quality PNG snapshot.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Node.js (optional, only for development tools)

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project root and install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application

Start the FastAPI backend server:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage

1.  **Open the Graph**: Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
2.  **Tutorial**: Follow the on-screen tutorial to understand the interface.
3.  **Explore**:
    *   **Zoom/Pan**: Use your mouse to navigate the graph.
    *   **Hover**: Hover over a node to see its connections.
    *   **Click**: Click a node to open the Right Sidebar with details.
4.  **Filter**: Use the Left Sidebar to show/hide specific categories.
5.  **Cluster**: Select an algorithm in the Analysis section and click "Run Clustering".

## Technologies

*   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Cytoscape.js
*   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, NetworkX, Scikit-learn, Pandas, SciPy
*   **Data**: CSV-based annotations converted to JSON graph format
